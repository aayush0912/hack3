PROBLEM:

A pathologist was matching DNAs using its components such as Adenine, Cytosine, etc.
He identified that there are total 26 components represented by 26 letters of the English
alphabet. Given a sequence of Gene components, his task was to return the similarity
between the two components. He considered the following similarity metric
Similarity: sum(len(G1),len(G2)) - Dis(G1,G2)), where Dis is the minimum modification
distance between two gene sequences. Following three modification operations are
allowed - insert, replace and delete and each operation costs 1. Modification distance
between two strings is defined as minimum total cost incurred to convert one string to
other.
Effect of three operations can be understood from the following example. Let us say the
initial string (gene) is ABCDD:
Insert F at the end == ABCDDF
Replace A with V == VBCDDF
Delete F from end == VBCDD
For given genes: ABCGT and GTBAC
Similarity=10-5 = 5 where 10 is the sum of length of both the string and 5 is the minimum
number of required operations.
Given a pair of gene sequences calculate the Similarity using memoization.

INPUT FORMAT:
Enter gene1= ABCGT
Enter gene2= GTBAC

Output:
Similarity: 5
Total number of operations required =5
